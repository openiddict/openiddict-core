    # Arcade only allows the revision to contain up to two characters, and GitHub Actions does not roll-over
    # build numbers every day like Azure DevOps does. To balance these two requirements, set the official
    # build ID to be the same format as the built-in default from Arcade, except with the revision number
    # being the number of the quarter hour of the current time of day (24 * 4 = 96, which is less than 100).
    # So a build between 00:00 and 00:14 would have a revision of 1, and a build between 23:45 and 23:59:59
    # would have a revision of 97.
